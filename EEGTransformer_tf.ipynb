        "- `ffn_output_dim` (int): Specifies the output size of the feed-forward network.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Attributes:\n",
        "- `positional_encoding` (torch.Tensor): A tensor of shape `(num_channels, num_timepoints)` that imparts the sequence position information.\n",
        "- `multihead_attn` (nn.MultiheadAttention): Implements the multi-head self-attention mechanism.\n",
        "- `ffn` (nn.Sequential): Constructs a feed-forward network composed of a linear transformation followed by ReLU activation and another linear transformation.\n",

        "- `classifier` (nn.Linear): Deploys a final linear transformation layer to categorize the input into designated classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Methods:\n",
        "- `forward(X)`: Outlines the forward propagation for the model.\n",
        "  - `X` (torch.Tensor): The input tensor for EEG data, which should have a shape of `(batch_size, num_channels, num_timepoints)`.\n",
        "\n",

        "    7. Yield the final output.\n",
        "  \n",
        "### Notes:\n",
        "\n",
        "- The model applies layer normalization after the multi-head self-attention and feed-forward network stages.\n",
        "- Positional encoding is utilized to impart sequence position information to the model, which can either be relative or absolute.\n",
        "- The classifier layer flattens the model output and categorizes it into `output_dim` classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Usage:\n",
        "\n",
        "To employ the `EEGTransformer` model, instantiate the class using the desired parameters. Then, similar to any other PyTorch model, forward the input data to the model and utilize the returned output for either training or inference.\n",

In this context, it is also common to refer to the output matrix of each self-attention as a head. In particular, the multi-head self-attention, denoted $ \\text{MSHA}(\\tilde{\\mathbf{X}}_i) : \\mathbb{R}^{c\\times p} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^{d_h\\times p} $, is defined as\n",
